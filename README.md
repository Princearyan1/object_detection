# 🔍 Object Detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV

#prince aryan

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model with OpenCV's `dnn` module. It can detect and classify multiple objects in images, videos, or webcam streams.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects multiple objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- Fast and accurate detection using YOLOv3
- Supports image files, video files, and live webcam feed
- Easy to configure and customize

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- YOLOv
